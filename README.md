# stopwatch

On Galaxy A3 (2017), there is a stopwatch application (inside Clock). I've been using it for various reasons. There's one thing that annoys me about the app; the RESET button. Once you touch/click it, it resets the watch without any confirmation. Sometimes I accidentally touch it and lose all the data. This happened several times. I'm fed up with it...

This annoyed me so much that I wanted to write my own stopwatch. I've based it on the mobile app (the GUI). Added a few improvements (save data, confirm reset, reversed laps order [from descending to ascending]).
